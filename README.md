# Meeting Summarizer with LangGraph Agents

This project transforms **multimodal meeting artifacts** â€” including audio, video, or raw text notes â€” into **structured, actionable summaries** using a **LangGraph-orchestrated multi-agent pipeline** powered by **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro**.  

The system can transcribe conversations, identify speakers, extract key decisions, generate tasks, synthesize spoken summaries via TTS, and even compose short highlight videos using MoviePy.  
A **Gradio UI** allows teams to trigger the workflow interactively and monitor each agentâ€™s execution status through LangGraphâ€™s real-time visualization.

## ðŸ§  How It Works â€” LangGraph + Agents Overview

The summarizer runs a **five-node LangGraph workflow** that mirrors the deterministic pipeline used elsewhere in the project. Each node focuses on one responsibility and hands its output to the next step:

| Agent | Description | Input â†’ Output |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| ðŸŽ§ **Transcribe** | Converts audio/video to text or reads text files directly. | Media/Text â†’ Transcript |
| ðŸ§© **Summarize** | Generates a concise meeting recap with Gemini (falls back to local summarizer if needed). | Transcript â†’ Summary |
| ï¿½ **Insights** | Extracts action items and discussion topics via spaCy + sentence transformers (or Gemini JSON). | Transcript â†’ `{actions, topics}` |
| ï¿½ **Narrate** | Produces a spoken version of the summary using the configured TTS engine. | Summary â†’ Audio file |
| ðŸŽ¬ **Compose Video** | Renders a highlight reel with animated slides and narrated audio via MoviePy. | Summary + Audio â†’ Video |

### ðŸ”— LangGraph Integration
- **Sequential graph:** Nodes execute in order with automatic skips if results already exist.
- **LLM optionality:** If Gemini is unavailable, the graph falls back to deterministic summarization and insight extraction.
- **Deterministic safety net:** Missing audio/video assets trigger regeneration using the local pipeline to guarantee complete outputs.
- **Live inspection:** The Gradio UI exposes current node status and dependency health through the `inspect_workflow()` endpoint.

## Key Components

- **LangGraph Orchestrator**: `app/langgraph_orchestrator.py` coordinates the end-to-end agent sequence  
  (transcribe â†’ summarize â†’ analyze â†’ TTS â†’ compose).  
  The graph automatically falls back to the deterministic pipeline if any optional dependency is missing.

- **Deterministic Fallback Pipeline**: `app/orchestrator.py` mirrors the classic behavior so the UI and CLI always return usable outputs.

- **Interactive UI**: `ui/app_gradio.py` exposes toggles for LangGraph orchestration, verbose logging, and live workflow inspection.
