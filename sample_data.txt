Meeting Transcript - Project Phoenix Weekly Sync

Date: 2025-10-05
Attendees: Alice (PM), Bob (Dev), Carol (QA), David (UX), Eve (DevOps)

Alice: Good morning everyone. Let's start with the weekly status update for Project Phoenix. Bob, can you give us a quick rundown on the development progress?

Bob: Sure, Alice. The frontend module for the dashboard is 90% complete. We have integrated the new API endpoints, and most of the UI components are functional. However, there are a few bugs related to the dynamic chart rendering that need attention.

Carol: Regarding QA, we have completed testing the login and authentication flow. There were minor issues with password resets, which have been documented. We will start end-to-end testing on the dashboard module once Bob's fixes are deployed.

David: On the UX side, I have prepared the revised wireframes for the reporting module. Feedback from last week's user testing session was incorporated, especially regarding navigation and filter options. The team should review these designs before development begins.

Eve: From a DevOps perspective, the staging environment has been updated with the latest backend changes. CI/CD pipelines are running smoothly, but we noticed some slowdowns during peak hours that might require optimization.

Alice: Thanks, everyone. Action items from last week: Bob, finish chart bug fixes; Carol, start dashboard end-to-end testing; David, finalize wireframes; Eve, monitor CI/CD performance. Any blockers?

Bob: No major blockers, just need more info on the expected chart behaviors from UX.

David: I can send detailed specs by EOD today.

Carol: I am good, will begin testing once fixes are in.

Alice: Perfect. Next, let's discuss the feature prioritization for the upcoming sprint. We have three main requests from stakeholders: 1) Advanced reporting filters, 2) Real-time notifications, 3) User analytics dashboard.

Bob: I suggest we implement the filters first since the backend is almost ready. Notifications can be added later in the sprint, and analytics dashboard will require further data modeling.

David: Agreed. From a UX perspective, filters should be intuitive. We might need to create mockups for stakeholder approval before dev begins.

Eve: Technically, real-time notifications will require additional infrastructure. We should allocate time to research optimal solutions.

Alice: Great. Let's set the sprint plan as: Filters in week one, Notifications in week two, Analytics dashboard in week three. Bob, update the Jira tickets accordingly.

Bob: Will do.

Alice: Any other points?

Carol: Just a reminder that regression testing will be scheduled on Friday.

Alice: Thanks, everyone. Meeting adjourned at 11:15 AM.
